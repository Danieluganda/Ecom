Mircoservicee Architecture


    





Creating a full microservices eCommerce system involves designing 
and implementing intricate communication between different services. 
Here's a high-level architecture that typically suits such kind of systems:



User Service: Handle user data and provide functions for registering, updating, retrieving and deleting users.



Authentication Service: Takes care of user authentication (login, logout) and user authorization for accessing the different services.



Product Service: Takes care of all the product related information. This includes the watch details like name, brand, images, etc.



Inventory Service: Handles inventory control, item availability, and inventory sourcing.



Cart Service: Manages the users' carts, including adding, updating, deleting items, calculating totals etc.



Order Service: Takes care of processing and tracking orders, registering the transaction for an order etc.



Payment Service: This service is responsible for handling all the payment related tasks. It carefully processes the payment information supplied by user and never stores sensitive info like card details in the system.



Notification Service: Handles emails or other types of notifications that need to be sent to the user.



API Gateway: The main point of entry for clients. It forwards requests to appropriate services, handles request/response transformation, and might implement some additional cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, SSL termination, load balancing etc.



Service Registry & Discovery: Every service must be registered in a discovery server, and services will talk with each other through the service discovery.



Logging and Monitoring: Centralized logging and monitoring of each individual service is essential to keep tabs on system health and debug issues in a microservices architecture.



Distributed Tracing: Trace id propagated across the call chain of a transaction to understand how a single transaction/system behaves.




All these services are isolated and independently deployable applications, and should be run inside Docker containers. Deployment of the entire system can be managed using Kubernetes or a similar orchestratory tool. Communication between services would be handled via HTTP/REST or a message queue for asynchronous tasks.


Remember, a microservices architecture also brings additional complexity, so you should consider the trade-offs before opting for this strategy. It depends largely on the team's expertise, the requirements of the system like scalability and resilience, and business requirements.


Finally, each microservice would require a CI/CD pipeline, doing automatic build, testing, and deployment. For every microservice, treat it as a

**********************************

Creating a full-functioning microservices eCommerce system involves designing a system architecture that splits application functionalities into small, loosely-coupled services. Here's a high-level architecture proposal:



User Service: Handles user data and operations like registration, authentication, and user profile management.



Product Catalog Service: This service handles operations related to the product catalog like CRUD operations for products, categories, brands, etc.



Inventory Service: Responsible for tracking the stock of each product in the inventory.



Cart Service: Manages the customers' shopping cart data and operations like add, remove, or update product quantities.



Order Service: Handles order management operations including order creation, order payment, and order history.



Payment Service: Responsible for processing payments and transactions.



Recommendation Service: As an optional and complementary service to provide product recommendations based on user behavior and history.



Email Service: Another optional service that sends out emails to users for things like order confirmations, promotions, etc.



API Gateway: Serves as a single-entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservice and provides other cross-cutting functionalities like request rate limiting, authentication, and authorization.



Database(s): Depending on the service, you might need different types of databases. For example, for the Product Catalog Service, a document database like MongoDB could be more suitable, while for User Service, a relational database like MySQL might be better.




To improve fault tolerance and reliability, you could introduce replication and redundancy where each service could have multiple running instances. All the services could be containerized using Docker and managed using Kubernetes.


Keep in mind, this is a high-level solution, and the actual implementation will depend on your specific use case, requirements, and constraints.


Note: Inter-service communication could be implemented using REST or gRPC and asynchronous messaging (like Kafka/RabbitMQ).
